# Lillydoo_Test
Lillydoo Test project Hi folks,

I am Seetha, working as a FrontEnd developer in HCL Gmbh for Deutsche Bank projects.

This project is related to the below user story,

Creation a view for the following layout.

User story: When on the trial pack page, you have the opportunity to select a size from 1 to 5 for my trial pack. The image of the trial pack changes, depending on which diaper size you choose. Sizes 1 and 2 contain the 99% water wipes and sizes 3 to 5 contain the sensitive wipes. All sizes contain a small pack of (10) diapers.

In the section “Dein Testpaket enthält” you can see a preview image of the diaper and the wet wipes. The image of the wet wipes changes, depending on the selected diaper size. The trial pack page is fully responsive.

Technologies used: Vue.js CSS3 Bootstrap

You can find a demo of the page here: https://www.lillydoo.com/de/testpaket

Thanks, Seetha Lakshmi P.L
